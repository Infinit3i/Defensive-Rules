This repository is a curated collection of detection rules authored by Matthew Iverson, organized first by rule type (Sigma or Splunk), and then by data source (Windows, Syslog, Zeek). The goal is to provide defenders with a centralized, modular resource for quickly identifying and deploying high-fidelity detections across multiple log types and platforms. While these rules are currently untested, they are based on real-world use cases, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, and written with clarity and customization in mind.

### Sigma
    - windows
    - syslog
    - zeek

### Splunk
    - windows
    - syslog
    - zeek

**NONE OF THESE ARE TESTED YET**
