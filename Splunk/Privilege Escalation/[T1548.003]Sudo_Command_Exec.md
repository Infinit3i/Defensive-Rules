# [T1548.003] Sudo Command Exec

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Privilege Escalation*

#### Description:  
Detects command execution via `sudo`, which may indicate privilege escalation attempts or administrative activity on Linux systems. This rule inspects syslog entries for patterns that include both `sudo:` and `COMMAND=` to capture elevated command usage.

```bash
index=syslog sourcetype="syslog" ("sudo:" AND "COMMAND=")
| table _time, host, user, Message
```
