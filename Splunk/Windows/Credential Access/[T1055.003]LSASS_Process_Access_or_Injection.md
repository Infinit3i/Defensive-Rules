# [T1055.003] LSASS_Process_Access_Or_Injection

### Mitre Tactic  

*Credential Access*

---

#### Description  

Detects suspicious handle requests or code injection into `lsass.exe`, a common technique for in-memory credential theft. Monitors Sysmon Event ID 10 for high-privilege access codes (full, query information, duplicate handle, debug) against LSASS, and Event ID 8 for CreateRemoteThread calls targeting LSASS.

---

```bash
index=sysmon (
    (EventCode=10 AND TargetImage="*\\lsass.exe" AND (
        GrantedAccess="*0x1F0FFF*" OR 
        GrantedAccess="*0x1FFFFF*" OR 
        GrantedAccess="*0x1410*" OR 
        GrantedAccess="*0x143A*"
    ))
    OR
    (EventCode=8 AND TargetImage="*\\lsass.exe")
)
| table _time, host, EventCode, SourceImage, TargetImage, GrantedAccess, User
```
