# \[T1003.003] NTDS.dit Extraction via Mimikatz

### Mitre Tactic:

*Credential Access*

---

#### Description:

Detects suspicious interactions with the Active Directory database (`ntds.dit`) using Event IDs 216, 325, 326, and 327. These events relate to database location changes, new database creations, and database attach/detach operations. Adversaries like Mimikatz exploit these actions to extract credentials from offline copies of `ntds.dit`.

```bash
index=wineventlog AND (EventCode IN ("216","325","326","327") AND Message="*ntds.dit*")
```
