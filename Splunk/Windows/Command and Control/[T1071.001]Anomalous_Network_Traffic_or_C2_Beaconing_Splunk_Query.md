# [T1071] Small_TCP_Payload_Beacon_Detection_Splunk_Query

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Command and Control*

---

#### Description:  
Detects frequent, small-size TCP communications (≤150 bytes) that may indicate beaconing or “heartbeat” traffic used by adversaries for C2 channels. Aggregates counts by source–destination pairs and flags flows exceeding a threshold of 20 events.

```bash
index=network Protocol="tcp" PayloadSize<=150
| stats count by src, dest
| where count > 20
| sort -count
| table src, dest, count
```
