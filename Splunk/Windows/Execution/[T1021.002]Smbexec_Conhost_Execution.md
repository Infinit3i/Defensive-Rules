# [T1021.002] Smbexec Conhost Execution

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Execution*

#### Description:  
Detects `conhost.exe` launched with `0xffffffff -ForceV1`, commonly used by `smbexec.py` when spawning a console session tied to command execution. This follows `cmd.exe` running the temporary batch file.

```bash
index=wineventlog EventCode=4688
| where Image="*\\conhost.exe" AND CommandLine LIKE "%0xffffffff%" AND CommandLine LIKE "%ForceV1%"
| table _time, host, SubjectUserName, Image, CommandLine, ParentImage
| sort _time desc
```
