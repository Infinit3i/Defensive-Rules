# [T1569.002] PsExec Execution

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Execution*

#### Description:  
Detects the use of `PsExec`, a legitimate remote administration tool frequently leveraged by adversaries to execute commands remotely. Detection is based on process creation events from Windows Event Logs (4688) and Sysmon (Event ID 1), focusing on command lines or image paths containing `psexec`.

```spl
index=wineventlog (EventCode=4688 OR EventCode=1) (CommandLine="*psexec*" OR Image="*\\psexec.exe")
| table _time, host, user, CommandLine, Image, ParentProcessName
```
