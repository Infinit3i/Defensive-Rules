# [T1021.002] Smbexec Batch Execution

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Execution*

#### Description:  
Detects use of `%COMSPEC%` or `cmd.exe /Q /c` to echo commands into `C:\Windows\TEMP\execute.bat`, then execute and delete it. This pattern is typical of `smbexec.py` when sending one-off commands rather than starting an interactive shell.

```bash
index=wineventlog EventCode=4688
| where CommandLine LIKE "%C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\execute.bat%"
| table _time, host, SubjectUserName, Image, CommandLine, ParentImage
| sort _time desc
```
