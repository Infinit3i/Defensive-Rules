# [T1021.002] Smbexec Logon Events

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Lateral Movement*

#### Description:  
Detects authentication and logon artifacts generated by Impacket's `smbexec.py`. This includes credential validation (4776), admin-level privileges (4672), and interactive network logons (4624). These appear in multiple rounds if an interactive shell is opened.

```bash
index=wineventlog EventCode IN (4776, 4672, 4624) LogonType=3
| table _time, host, EventCode, SubjectUserName, TargetUserName, LogonType, AuthenticationPackageName
| sort _time desc
```
