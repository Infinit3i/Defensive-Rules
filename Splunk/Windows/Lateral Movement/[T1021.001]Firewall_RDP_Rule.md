# [T1021.001] Firewall RDP Rule

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Lateral Movement*

#### Description:  
Detects the creation or modification of firewall rules that allow Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) traffic. This may indicate preparation for lateral movement or unauthorized remote access. Detection is based on Windows Security Event ID 4946, which logs inbound firewall rule changes.

```bash
index=wineventlog EventCode=4946 ("3389" OR "Remote Desktop")
| table _time, host, user, EventCode, Message
```
