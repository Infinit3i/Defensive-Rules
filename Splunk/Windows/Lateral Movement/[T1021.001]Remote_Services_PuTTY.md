# [T1021.001] Remote Services: PuTTY Plink Execution

### Mitre Tactic:

*Lateral Movement*

#### Description:

Detects execution of `plink.exe`, a command-line utility used by PuTTY for SSH tunneling and remote access. Attackers commonly abuse `plink.exe` for lateral movement or to maintain covert access to compromised systems. This rule leverages Windows Security Event ID 4688, which records process creations.

```bash
index=wineventlog EventCode=4688
| where ProcessName="plink.exe" OR New_Process_Name LIKE "%\\plink.exe"
| table _time, host, EventCode, New_Process_Name, Parent_Process_Name, Creator_Process_Name, Account_Name, Command_Line
| sort _time desc
```
