# [T1021.001] Remote Services: PuTTY Plink Execution

### Mitre Tactic:

*Lateral Movement*

#### Description:

Detects execution of `plink.exe`, a command-line utility used by PuTTY for SSH tunneling and remote access. Attackers commonly abuse `plink.exe` for lateral movement or to maintain covert access to compromised systems. This rule leverages Windows Security Event ID 4688, which records process creations.

```bash
index=wineventlog EventCode=4688 ProcessName="plink.exe"
```
