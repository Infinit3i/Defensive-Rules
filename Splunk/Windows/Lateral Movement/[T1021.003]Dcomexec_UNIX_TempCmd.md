# [T1021.003] Dcomexec UNIX Epoch Output Redirect

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Lateral Movement*

#### Description:  
Detects output redirection to a path that includes the first 5 digits of the UNIX Epoch Time (e.g., `__sssss`) which is characteristic of `dcomexec.py`. This behavior is logged in Security Event ID 4688 where `mmc.exe` spawns `cmd.exe /Q /C`.

```bash
index=wineventlog EventCode=4688
| where Image="*\\cmd.exe" AND CommandLine LIKE "%127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__%"
| table _time, host, SubjectUserName, Image, CommandLine, ParentImage
| sort _time desc
```
