# [T1021.002] Remote Command Exec

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Lateral Movement*

#### Description:  
Detects potential remote command execution using tools and methods such as `PsExec`, `winrs`, `wmic /node:`, or `wmiexec`. These techniques are often employed by attackers during lateral movement to execute commands on remote systems. The detection uses both Windows Event Logs (Event ID 4688) and Sysmon (Event ID 1) for coverage across different logging configurations.

```spl
index=wineventlog (EventCode=4688 OR EventCode=1) ("psexec" OR "winrs" OR "wmic /node:" OR "wmiexec")
| table _time, host, user, CommandLine, Image, ParentProcessName
