# [T1543.003] Service Install

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Persistence*

#### Description:  
Detects new services being installed, which may be used by attackers for persistence or privilege escalation. It combines Windows System Event ID 7045 (service installation) with Sysmon Event ID 1 (process creation) to provide additional context on how the service was created. Common indicators include the use of `sc create`, `New-Service`, or service-related PowerShell and binaries like `srvany.exe`.

```spl
( index=wineventlog EventCode=7045) OR ( index=sysmon EventCode=1 AND (CommandLine LIKE "%sc create%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%New-Service%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%powershell%service%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%srvany.exe%"))
| table _time, EventCode, ServiceName, ServiceFileName, CommandLine, Image, User, ComputerName
| sort _time desc
```
