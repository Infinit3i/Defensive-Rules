# [T1547.001] Startup File Drop

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Persistence*

#### Description:  
Detects creation of potentially malicious files such as `.exe`, `.bat`, `.vbs`, or `.ps1` in common persistence locations like Startup folders or AppData directories. Adversaries frequently use these paths to achieve persistence across reboots. This detection leverages Sysmon Event ID 11 (FileCreate) for visibility into file write activity.

```spl
index=sysmon EventCode=11
| where TargetFilename LIKE "%\\AppData\\%" OR TargetFilename LIKE "%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\%"
| where TargetFilename LIKE "%.exe" OR TargetFilename LIKE "%.bat" OR TargetFilename LIKE "%.ps1" OR TargetFilename LIKE "%.vbs"
| table _time, Image, TargetFilename, ProcessId, ComputerName
| sort _time desc
