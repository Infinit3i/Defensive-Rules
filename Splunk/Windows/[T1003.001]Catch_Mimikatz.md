# [T1003.001] LSASS Memory Access

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Credential Access*

---

#### Description:  
Detects suspicious access to `lsass.exe` memory or execution of known Mimikatz-related binaries and commands. Leverages Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation) and Event ID 10 (Process Access) to surface processes dumping or interacting with LSASS.

```spl
index=sysmon (EventCode=1 OR EventCode=10)
| where (TargetImage LIKE "%lsass.exe%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%sekurlsa%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%logonpasswords%")
| table _time, EventCode, Image, TargetImage, CommandLine, SourceProcessId, TargetProcessId, ComputerName
| sort _time desc
```
