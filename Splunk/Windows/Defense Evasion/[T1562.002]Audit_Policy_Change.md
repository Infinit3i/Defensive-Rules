# [T1562.002] Audit Policy Change

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Defense Evasion*

#### Description:  
Detects changes to system audit policies, which may indicate an attempt to disable logging or evade detection. This detection uses Windows Security Event ID 4719 (audit policy change) and Sysmon Event ID 1 (process creation) to capture the use of tools commonly associated with audit policy manipulation, such as `auditpol`, `secedit`, or `wevtutil`.

```spl
(
  index=wineventlog EventCode=4719
)
OR
(
  index=sysmon EventCode=1
  AND (CommandLine LIKE "%auditpol%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%secedit%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%wevtutil% cl%")
)
| table _time, EventCode, SubjectUserName, CommandLine, Image, ComputerName
| sort _time desc
```
