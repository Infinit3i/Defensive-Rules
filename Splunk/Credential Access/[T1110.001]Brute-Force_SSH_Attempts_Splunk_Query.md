# [T1110.001] Brute Force: Password Guessing

### Mitre Tactic:

*Credential Access*

#### Description:

Detects repeated **failed SSH authentication attempts** within a short timeframe, which may indicate brute-force activity. Adversaries often attempt multiple password guesses against SSH services to gain initial access or escalate privileges. This rule uses Zeek SSH logs to track failed logins (`auth_success=F`) and flags sources exceeding 5 failures within 5 minutes.

```bash
index=zeek sourcetype="zeek:ssh" auth_success=F
| bin _time span=5m
| stats count by id.orig_h, id.resp_h, _time
| where count > 5
| sort - count
| table _time, id.orig_h, id.resp_h, count
```
