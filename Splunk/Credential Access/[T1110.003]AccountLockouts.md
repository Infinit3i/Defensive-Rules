### Mitre Tactic:  
*Credential Access*

#### Description:  
Detects user account lockouts which may indicate password spraying, brute force attacks, or unauthorized login attempts. This detection uses Windows Security Event ID 4740 to identify repeated lockouts, which may be a sign of credential access attempts by an adversary.
