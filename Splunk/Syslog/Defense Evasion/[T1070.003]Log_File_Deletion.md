# [T1070.003] Log File Deletion

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Defense Evasion*

#### Description:  
Detects attempts to delete, truncate, or clear log files, particularly `/var/log`, which is a common evasion technique on Linux systems. Adversaries may use commands like `rm -rf /var/log` or `log cleared` messages to cover their tracks. This rule scans syslog for such indicators.

```bash
index=syslog sourcetype="syslog" ("rm -rf /var/log" OR "rm -f /var/log" OR "deleted log" OR "truncated log" OR "log cleared")
| table _time, host, Message
```
