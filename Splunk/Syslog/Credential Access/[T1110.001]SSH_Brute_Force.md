# [T1110.001] SSH Brute Force

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Credential Access*

#### Description:  
Detects multiple failed SSH login attempts from the same IP address within a short time window, which may indicate a brute-force attack. Uses syslog patterns such as `Failed password for` and aggregates failures over 5-minute spans.

```bash
index=syslog sourcetype="syslog" "Failed password for"
| rex "Failed password for (?:invalid user )?\S+ from (?<src_ip>\d{1,3}(?:\.\d{1,3}){3})"
| bin _time span=5m
| stats count by _time, src_ip
| where count > 5
| sort - _time
| table _time, src_ip, count
```
