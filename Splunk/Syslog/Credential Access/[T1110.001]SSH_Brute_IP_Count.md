# [T1110.001] SSH Brute IP Count

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Credential Access*

#### Description:  
Detects IP addresses with a high number of failed SSH login attempts, indicating potential brute-force attacks. This query counts repeated `Failed password for` events in `sshd` logs and filters for IPs exceeding 5 attempts.

```bash
index=syslog sourcetype="syslog" "sshd" "Failed password for"
| stats count by src_ip
| where count > 5
| sort - count
| table src_ip, count
```
