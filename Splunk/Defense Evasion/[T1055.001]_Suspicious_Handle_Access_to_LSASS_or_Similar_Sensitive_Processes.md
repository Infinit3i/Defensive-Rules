# [T1055.001] Suspicious Handle Access to LSASS or Similar Sensitive Processes

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Defense Evasion*

#### Description:  
Detects suspicious handle access to sensitive processes such as `lsass.exe`, `winlogon.exe`, or `spoolsv.exe`, which are common targets for credential dumping or process injection. This detection uses Sysmon Event ID 10 (Process Access) and Event ID 8 (Create Remote Thread) to identify potential abuse of access rights and memory manipulation. High-sensitivity access rights like `0x1F0FFF` or `0x1fffff` are strong indicators of malicious intent.

```spl
index=sysmon (((EventCode=10 AND (TargetImage="*\\lsass.exe" OR TargetImage="*\\winlogon.exe" OR TargetImage="*\\spoolsv.exe")
     AND GrantedAccess="*0x1F0FFF*" OR GrantedAccess="*0x1fffff*" OR GrantedAccess="*0x143a*" OR GrantedAccess="*0x1410*")) OR (EventCode=8 AND (TargetImage="*\\lsass.exe" OR TargetImage="*\\winlogon.exe" OR TargetImage="*\\spoolsv.exe")))
| table _time, host, EventCode, SourceImage, TargetImage, GrantedAccess, User
