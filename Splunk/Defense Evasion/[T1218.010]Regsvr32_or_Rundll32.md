# [T1218.010] Regsvr32 or Rundll32

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Defense Evasion*

#### Description:  
Detects execution of `regsvr32.exe` or `rundll32.exe`, both of which are commonly abused for proxy execution of malicious code while evading detection. This behavior may indicate use of signed, legitimate Windows utilities to run arbitrary payloads. The detection leverages Sysmon process creation logs (Event ID 1) for visibility into execution context.

```spl
index=sysmon (Image="*\\regsvr32.exe" OR Image="*\\rundll32.exe")
| table _time, host, Image, CommandLine, ParentProcessName
```
