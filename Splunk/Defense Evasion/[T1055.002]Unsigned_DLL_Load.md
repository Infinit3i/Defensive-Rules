# [T1055.002] Unsigned DLL Load

### Mitre Tactic:  
*Defense Evasion*

#### Description:  
Detects the loading of DLLs from non-standard or potentially suspicious directories such as `Temp`, `Users\Public`, or `AppData\Local\Temp`. This behavior may indicate the use of unsigned or malicious DLLs for code injection or stealthy execution. Detection is based on Sysmon's `ImageLoaded` field to track DLL loads at runtime.

```bash
index=sysmon ImageLoaded="*.dll" (Image="*\\Temp\\" OR Image="*\\Users\\Public\\" OR Image="*\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\")
| table _time, host, ImageLoaded, Image, ProcessId, ProcessName
```
