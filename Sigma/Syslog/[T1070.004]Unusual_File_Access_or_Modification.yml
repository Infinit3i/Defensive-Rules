status: experimental
description: "Detects unusual file access or modification events by monitoring syslog messages for keywords such as 'modified', 'changed', 'deleted', or 'created' in relation to sensitive files or directories (e.g., /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/sudoers, /etc/group, /var/log), which may signal potential indicator removal or tampering."
