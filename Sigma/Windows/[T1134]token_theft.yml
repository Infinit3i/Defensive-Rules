title: Suspicious Domain Token Theft or Impersonation
id: 12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0
status: experimental
description: Detects behavior that may indicate the theft or impersonation of domain tokens on a Windows system. This rule focuses on Sysmon events that capture process access operations (Event ID 10) and remote thread creation (Event ID 8) against high-value processes like LSASS or Winlogon,  which are common targets for credential or token theft.
