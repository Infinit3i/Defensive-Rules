title: Enabling RDP Through Firewall Modification Detected
id: 0e2a15fa-1234-5678-9abc-def098765432
status: experimental
description: >
  Detects modification of Windows Firewall rules that enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
  This rule looks for events (e.g. EventID 4946) that indicate a firewall rule change where the rule
  involves port 3389 or mentions "Remote Desktop". This behavior can be indicative of an adversary enabling RDP
  for remote access.
